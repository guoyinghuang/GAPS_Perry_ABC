{\bfseries Notes:} Panels (a), (b), and (c) present restults for female, male, and the overall population, respectively. The PSID weights are used to make each sample representative of its corresponding in the population. Disadvantaged blacks meet the  ABC eligibility criteria. Non-disadvantaged blacks do  not. All blacks include disadvantaged and non- disadvantaged blacks and represent the U.S. population of blacks. All  whites represents the entire U.S. population of whites.  Scenario 1 is the baseline scenario, where ABC is not available. Scenario 2  makes the ABC Program available to all disadvantaged blacks. The intra- black gap measures the difference in adult outcomes between the non- disadvantaged black population and the disadvantaged black population.  The black-white gap compares the difference in adult outcomes between the  whole black population and the whole white population. The cost is expressed in 2010 millions of dollars. In the subsection that presents the gaps the first two columns display the actual gaps. The third column shows the gap after the treatment effects of Perry are applied to the disadvantaged black. The fourth column presents the the percentagae change between the first and the third columns. The fifth colum displays the black-white gap after the treatment effects of ABC are applied to the disadvantaged black.  The last column presents the the percentagae change between the fifth and the second columns.} }

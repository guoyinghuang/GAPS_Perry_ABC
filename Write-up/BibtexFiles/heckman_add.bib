We identify these impacts using discontinuities in the probability of participation induced by program eligibility rules. Our strategy allows us to identify the effect of Head Start for the set of individuals in the neighborhoods of multiple discontinuities, which vary with family size, state and year (as opposed to a smaller set of individuals neighboring a single discontinuity). Participation in the program reduces the incidence of behavioral problems, serious health problems and obesity of male children at ages 12 and 13. It also lowers depression and obesity among adolescents, and reduces engagement in criminal activities for young adults.},

  abstract={This paper provides new estimates of the medium and long-term impacts of Head Start on the health and behavioral problems of its participants. We identify these impacts using discontinuities in the probability of participation induced by program eligibility rules. Our strategy allows us to identify the effect of Head Start for the set of individuals in the neighborhoods of multiple discontinuities, which vary with family size, state and year (as opposed to a smaller set of individuals neighboring a single discontinuity). Participation in the program reduces the incidence of behavioral problems, serious health problems and obesity of male children at ages 12 and 13. It also lowers depression and obesity among adolescents, and reduces engagement in criminal activities for young adults.},

	in medical treatment may be important determinants of children's

	also calls for a broader set of policies that target parents' health-related

The subjects were randomly assigned to preschool and school-age treatment conditions in a study design that permits a comparison of outcomes in students with preschool treatment followed by early elementary treatment (infancy-8 years), preschool treatment only (infancy-5 years), early elementary school treatment only (5 years-8 years), and untreated controls. At age 15, seven to ten years after any treatment was provided, those students who had preschool treatment scored significantly higher on individually administered tests of reading and mathematics and had fewer instances of grade retention and assignments to special education. The results support the relative efficacy of preschool treatment over that given in early elementary school. Policy implications stress the importance of providing high quality early childhood environments for impoverished children.},

     abstract = {This collaborative study assessed the long-term effects of early childhood education experience on children from low-income families. In 1976, 12 investigators, who had independently designed and implemented infant and preschool programs in the 1960s, pooled their original data and conducted a collaborative follow-up of the original subjects, who were aged 9-19 at the time. Coordination of data collection and joint analyses were supervised by two additional investigators. The multisample secondary analyses reported here addressed two general questions: Were there long-term effects of early childhood programs? Were programs more effective for some subgroups of the low-income population than for others? Outcome measures included indicators of school competence (special education assignment and grade retention), developed abilities (standardized intelligence and achievement tests), children's attitudes and values, and impact on the family. Each early childhood project was considered separately for each hypothesis test and the results of the separate hypothesis tests were pooled using a pooled-z technique. This procedure tested the null hypothesis that there was no average effect of program participation across the different early education programs. Detailed attrition analyses indicated that attrition was essentially random, introducing no noticeable biases into the data analyses. Results show that early education programs for children from low-income families had long-lasting effects in four areas: school competence, developed abilities, children's attitudes and values, and impact on the family. 1. Children who attended programs were significantly more likely to meet their school's basic requirements. Controlling for family background factors and initial ability, program graduates were significantly less likely to be assigned to special education classes and less likely to be retained in grade than were controls. The effect apparently operated for all the children regardless of sex, ethnic background, initial ability level, or early family background factors. 2. Children who attended early childhood programs surpassed their controls on the Stanford-Binet intelligence test for several years after the program had ended. There was no evidence that the programs differentially raised the IQ test scores of some subgroups of children (differing on sex, initial ability, and family background). There was some indication that program graduates performed better on achievement tests than did controls. 3. In 1976, children who had attended early education programs were significantly more likely than were controls to give achievement-related reasons, such as school or work accomplishments, for being proud of themselves. Older program graduates also rated their school performance significantly better than did controls. 4. Program participation also affected maternal attitudes toward school performance and vocational aspirations relative to those of the child. The school competence results are placed in a larger developmental context through exploration of two empirically derived paths from program participation to increased school competence. The educational, social, and economic significance of the results are discussed and implications for social policy are detailed.},

At age 15, seven to ten years after any treatment was provided, those students who had preschool treatment scored significantly higher on individually administered tests of reading and mathematics and had fewer instances of grade retention and assignments to special education. The results support the relative efficacy of preschool treatment over that given in early elementary school. Policy implications stress the importance of providing high quality early childhood environments for impoverished children.},

     abstract = {This collaborative study assessed the long-term effects of early childhood education experience on children from low-income families. In 1976, 12 investigators, who had independently designed and implemented infant and preschool programs in the 1960s, pooled their original data and conducted a collaborative follow-up of the original subjects, who were aged 9-19 at the time. Coordination of data collection and joint analyses were supervised by two additional investigators. The multisample secondary analyses reported here addressed two general questions: Were there long-term effects of early childhood programs? Were programs more effective for some subgroups of the low-income population than for others? Outcome measures included indicators of school competence (special education assignment and grade retention), developed abilities (standardized intelligence and achievement tests), children's attitudes and values, and impact on the family. Each early childhood project was considered separately for each hypothesis test and the results of the separate hypothesis tests were pooled using a pooled-z technique. This procedure tested the null hypothesis that there was no average effect of program participation across the different early education programs. Detailed attrition analyses indicated that attrition was essentially random, introducing no noticeable biases into the data analyses. Results show that early education programs for children from low-income families had long-lasting effects in four areas: school competence, developed abilities, children's attitudes and values, and impact on the family. 1. Children who attended programs were significantly more likely to meet their school's basic requirements. Controlling for family background factors and initial ability, program graduates were significantly less likely to be assigned to special education classes and less likely to be retained in grade than were controls. The effect apparently operated for all the children regardless of sex, ethnic background, initial ability level, or early family background factors. 2. Children who attended early childhood programs surpassed their controls on the Stanford-Binet intelligence test for several years after the program had ended. There was no evidence that the programs differentially raised the IQ test scores of some subgroups of children (differing on sex, initial ability, and family background). There was some indication that program graduates performed better on achievement tests than did controls. 3. In 1976, children who had attended early education programs were significantly more likely than were controls to give achievement-related reasons, such as school or work accomplishments, for being proud of themselves. Older program graduates also rated their school performance significantly better than did controls. 4. Program participation also affected maternal attitudes toward school performance and vocational aspirations relative to those of the child. The school competence results are placed in a larger developmental context through exploration of two empirically derived paths from program participation to increased school competence. The educational, social, and economic significance of the results are discussed and implications for social policy are detailed.},

     abstract = {The search for ways to prevent juvenile crime in the United States has become a matter of national urgency, as the incidence of serious offenses continues to rise. Most prevention initiatives focus on late childhood or adolescence. Such initiatives may be missing an important additional opportunity to intervene earlier in children's lives. This review of literature from criminology, psychology, and education shows that there exist key early childhood factors which are associated with later antisocial or delinquent behavior and that early childhood programs which seek to ameliorate the effects of those factors can prevent later antisocial or delinquent behavior. In particular, the review focuses on programs which have demonstrated long-term effects on antisocial behavior or delinquency. These programs have in common a combination of intensive family support and early education services, and effects on a broad range of child and family risk factors for delinquency. Moreover, there is promising evidence of their cost-effectiveness. As one element in a comprehensive plan to address poverty and other environmental causes of crime, programs combining family support with early education show promise in lessening the current devastating impact of delinquency on America's children and families.},

 {\scriptsize {\bfseries Notes:} The data on the Perry subjects come from the Perry Preschool program dataset. For all other groups we rely on data in the NLSY79 for individuals born between 1957 and 1964. The NLSY79 weights are used to make each sample representative of its correlative in the population. Disadvantaged blacks meet the Perry eligibility criteria. Non-disadvantaged blacks are those that do not meet Perry eligibility. All blacks include disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged blacks and represent the U.S. population of blacks. All whites represents the entire U.S. population of whites. Scenario 1 is the baseline scenario; the Perry program is not available. Scenario 2 makes the Perry Program available to all disadvantaged blacks. The intra-black gap measures the difference in adult outcomes between the non-disadvantaged black population and the disadvantaged black population. The black-white gap compares the difference in adult outcomes between the whole black population and the whole white population. Labor income is in 2000 dollars and the cost of intervention is in millions of 2010 dollars. Pre-treatment variables are measured at age three.

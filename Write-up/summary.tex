{\bfseries Notes:} The NLSY79/PSID weights are used to make each sample representative of the population. Disadvantaged blacks meet the  eligibility criteria of the respective ECI. Non-disadvantaged blacks do  not. All blacks include disadvantaged and non- disadvantaged blacks and represent the U.S. population of blacks. All  whites represents the entire U.S. population of whites. The intra- black gap measures the difference in adult outcomes between the non- disadvantaged black population and the disadvantaged black population.  The black-white gap compares the difference in adult outcomes between the  whole black population and the whole white population. The cost is expressed in 2010 millions of dollars. The first column labels the results presented in the next four columns. The second and third columns present results for Perry and the fourth and fifth for ABC. The gap with no intervention refers to Scenario 1, where people do not have access to the program. Gap after inteverntion represents Scenario 2, where the program is made available to all individuals and they are applied the average treatment effect. The change in gap refers to the  percentage change between these two scenarios. Since the treatment effects are not measured at the same ages we indicate the age at which the outcome is measured. The first number corresponds to Perry and the second to ABC.} }
